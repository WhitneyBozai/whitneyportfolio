        <h2>Exquisite Corpse</h2>
        <p>There was once a king who had a congenital disability in his legs, and he often felt unsure about himself because of his weak body and appearance. One day, he found a UFO in his garden and he helped the alien to repair it. The alien expressed his gratitude by offering king a chance to change his body into his ideal. king wished to the alien that he wants a pair of strong legs and a appearance that his people like, so the alien changed his legs into the legs just like alien's, because the alien's legs can move at a very high speed; He also changed the king's head into the head of dog, because the alien loves dog, and even the reason he came to earth was because of his love for dog. In the end, the king not only be good at hunting, and was loved by the people of the country, but they always want a chance to touch the king's head.</p>
