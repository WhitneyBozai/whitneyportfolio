        <h2>Lost & Found</h2>
        <p>The lost item is a pair of HUAWEI earbuds enclosed in a matte silver case. The case has an oval shape but is a little bit flat. Imagine slapping dough on a table, and that's roughly the shape of the case. The opening area has a parabolic curve above, with the small HUAWEI text in black. Beneath this curve, you'll find grey dots for Bluetooth signaling. On the right side of the grey dot is a flat grey button to enable Bluetooth functionality.</p>
