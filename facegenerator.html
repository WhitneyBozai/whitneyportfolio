        <h2>Face Generator</h2>
        <p>I designed them base on my dog, but when I started creating image in P5, I had no idea on how to draw his ears, so I changed the form of his ears. What I had discover about the form I chose through this assignment was that I cannot get dog's face to be proportionally the same in every size，but I think it became more interesting.</p>
