        <h2>Gluttonous Puppy</h2>
        <p>This game is about my experience with my dog.Whenever I go for a walk with my dog, he always looks for food, such as wild fruits and kitchen waste. Because I am afraid he may eat something poisonous, I will try to stop him from eating. That's why I designed a game where the player can control the dog not to eat the chocolate cake, and dog can eat cream cake to get point. The first scene is a welcome scene, player can press botton "Start" to start the game. Then the scene with switch to game scene, the player will be able to control the dog to run across the scene to eat cakes and aviod chocolate cake, if the dog touch the chocolate cake, the game will be over, and the scene will switch to the bad end scene, which player can choose to press button "restart" to restart the game.When dog eat ten cream cakes, the scene will switch to the good end scene.
