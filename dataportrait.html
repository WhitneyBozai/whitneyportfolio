        <h2>Data Portrait</h2>
        <p>I wanted to figure out how much time I spent in each place on each day of the week and present that data in a bar chart. And I wanted to see how much time I spent in each place as a percentage of the day, so I used a large rectangle to represent the time of a day and three small rectangles of different colors to represent the time I spent in each place.</p>
